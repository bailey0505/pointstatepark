    <h1> History of Point State Park</h1>

<p id="paragraphOne">“During a trip to negotiate with the French in 1753, Lieutenant George Washington, in the
  Virginia militia, passed through the land that would become Point State Park. He wrote about
  it in his journal.”</p>

  <p id="paragraphOne">"As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, and the Land in
     the Fork; which I think extremely well situated for a Fort, as it has the absolute
     Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface
     of the Water; and a considerable Bottom of flat, well-timbered Land all around it, very
     convenient for Building: The Rivers are each a Quarter of a Mile, or more, across, and
     run here very near at right Angles: Aligany bearing N. E. and Monongahela S. E. The
     former of these two is a very rapid and swift running Water; the other deep and still,
     without any perceptible fall."</p>

     <p id="paragraphOne">“During the mid-1700s, the armies of France and Great Britain vied for control of the
       Ohio Valley. Four different forts were built at the forks of the Ohio within a period
       of five years.”</p>

       <p id="paragraphOne">“In 1754, French forces captured an outpost known as Fort Prince George at the
         Point that had been erected by a force of Virginians. George Washington led British
         forces to recapture the fort, but suffered his first and only surrender at Fort
         Necessity, 50 miles to the south.”</p>

         <p id="paragraphOne">“The French then built Fort Duquesne at the Forks, which gave them control of the
           Ohio Valley. In 1755, General George Braddock led the British to capture the forks,
           but was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela, eight miles from the fort.”</p>

           <p id="paragraphOne">“In 1758, a British army of 6,000 lead by General John Forbes, marched west from
             Carlisle. Forbes stopped at Fort Ligonier, 50 miles to the southeast and made
             final preparations for the assault on Fort Duquesne.”</p>

          <p id="paragraphOne">“The French, realizing they were badly outnumbered, burned the fort and departed
             two days before the British arrived on November 25, 1758. The British built a
             temporary fort called Mercer’s Fort which was used until construction of Fort
             Pitt began in 1759. Fort Pitt, named in honor of William Pitt, secretary of
             state of Britain, was to be the most extensive fortification by the British in
             North America.”</p>

          <p id="paragraphOne">“The French were never to regain control as their other outposts in the region
            fell to the British. The only further action at Fort Pitt was in 1763 when it
            withstood American Indian attacks during Pontiac’s Insurrection.”</p>

          <p id="paragraphOne">“Fort Pitt was sold in 1772 and then reclaimed in 1774 by the Virginia Territory.
             In 1777, the Continental Army used Fort Pitt for its western headquarters.
             Troops and supplies were stockpiled to defend the new United States. The first
             Peace Treaty between the American Indians and the United States was signed at
             Fort Pitt in 1778. Fort Pitt was finally abandoned in 1792 due to its
             deteriorating condition. It had served to open the frontier to settlement as
             Pittsburgh became the ‘‘Gateway to the West."</p>

             <h1>Development of a Park</h1>

             <p id="paragraphOne">“Once a busy industrial zone, the area had deteriorated into a commercial slum
               by the 1940s. The development of a state park was authorized in 1945 and the
               first parcel of the 36-acre property was purchased the next year. The park was
               completed and dedicated in 1974. In 1975, Point State Park was designated a
               National Historic Landmark.”</p>
